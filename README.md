# Pineappleway
This repo contains the source code for my web app and mobile app project pineappleway.
The project is an e-commerce platorm designed for buying of pineapples by students on campus.

A walk through video was provided for the web app.
The Mobile app works similarly.
It should be noted that in order for the Mobile app to run and work with all functionalities the IP address provided in the IP code should conform to that on the present computer running it.
